For wider adoption in Web3 this can be implemented in below areas

Cryptocurrency exchanges often hold large amounts of customer funds in their custody. By using a multisignature wallet, they can ensure that no single person can access or spend these funds without the approval of multiple parties. This can help prevent fraud or theft and increase trust among their customers.

Investment funds: Cryptocurrency investment funds may have multiple investors, managers, or custodians who need to approve transactions. By using a multisignature wallet, they can ensure that all parties have a say in how the funds are managed, and that no single person can make unauthorized transactions.

Escrow services: Multisignature wallets can also be used for escrow services, where a third party holds funds in custody until certain conditions are met. By requiring multiple signatures to release the funds, the escrow service can ensure that all parties are satisfied with the outcome before the funds are released.

Personal use: Individuals who hold large amounts of cryptocurrency may want to use a multisignature wallet to protect their funds from theft or loss. By requiring multiple signatures to authorize transactions, they can ensure that their funds are safe even if one of their devices is compromised or lost.
